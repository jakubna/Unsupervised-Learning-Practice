The aim of the work, presented in this document, is to implement
the MinMax k-Means algorithm and to compare its effectiveness to other similar
algorithms using several different datasets and cluster quality metrics.

The main structure of this project is divided into four folders and the main file.

Folders:
algorithms: folder in which the implemented algorithms are stored.
datasets: folder in which the used datasets are stored. 
evaluations: folder for the main auxiliary, evaluation and plot functions. 
results: folder in which the output files are stored.

Files inside the principal folder:
main.py: the script to run all experiments from the project.
read_data.py: data pre-processing functions.
